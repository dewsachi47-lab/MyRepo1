# MyRepo1 — Next.js 16 + shadcn/ui (scaffold)

This commit adds a minimal Next.js 16 (app router) TypeScript app scaffolded with Tailwind CSS and a small set of shadcn-style UI components.

Quick start (using pnpm):

1. Install dependencies

   pnpm install

2. Run dev server

   pnpm dev

Notes:
- Branch: add-nextjs16-shadcn
- The project includes a small `components/ui/Button` inspired by shadcn/ui so you can get started immediately. To use the official shadcn CLI and components, run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` after installing dependencies.
